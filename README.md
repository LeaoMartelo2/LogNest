# LogNest

Simple C++ library to easily make logs on to a file.

## Installing:
`git clone https://github.com/LeaoMartelo2/LogNest`
`cd LogNest/src`
`sudo make install` 
<small>(or install manually to your project if you know what you are doing)</small>

# Usage:
- The main header should be included: 
`#include <lognest/lognest.hpp`

- To begin using the library, you'll need to create a logging object, you can have multiple of them, and they can even be channeled in to different files.
`auto log_example = std::make_shared<LogNest>("latest.log", "[log_example]")`;
	- here, the first argument (`latest.log`) defines where that object's logging will be channeled in to.
	- the second argument (`[log_example]`), will be the identifier of the logging object, in case there are multiple objects logging to the same file.
	
- Following the example given above, we can create a log using
`log_example->log(LN_LOG, "Hello, {}", "World!");`
	- You can use the provided log types, all of them have the prefix `LN`
	- (`LN_LOG`, `LN_WARN`, `LN_ERROR`, `LN_DEBUG`)
	- The text argument takes a formatting argument `{}`, that will be replaced with the next argument provided after it.
	- Example: (`"{}, {}!", "Hello, World", 2024`)
