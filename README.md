# Simple Header file only library in C to easily make log files 

![image](images/example2.png)

## Installing:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeaoMartelo2/LogNest/main/lognest.h
```

- You can just grab the lognest.h file and add it to your project,
- You need to remember that only including the file serves as forward declaring/API
- for the library to serve as implementation, add: `#define LOGNEST_IMPLEMENTATION` before the `#include`
- remember to also `#define LOGNEST_FILE "<your/file/path/here.log>"`
