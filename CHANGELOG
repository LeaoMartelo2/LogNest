### LogNest 2.1.6

- Fix issue with `LOGNEST_API` macro causing some issues with its defult behaviour, now its up to the user to enable it.
- Add macro to replace force exiting / crashing on error function with your own.

### LogNest 2.1.5 

- Added `LOGNEST_API` macro (defaulted to `static inline`) to allow you to change how lognest functions are defined.

- Added macros to change the prefix of the log level identifier, add this before the implementation define:

```c 
#define LOGNEST_<TRACE/WARN/ERROR/DEBUG>_PREFIX "<custom prefix goes here>"
```

- Added split the macro to divide the timestamp do allow to individually disable the date-stamp with `#define LOGNEST_DISABLE_DATESTAMP`
- Renamed some internal macros with common names to avoid name hogging.
- Added a option to allow crashing on error:
```c
#define LOGNEST_ALLOW_CRASH
```

### LogNest 2.1 

- Renamed some internal functions to avoid name hogging.
- Added the ability to disable the `Timestamp` on logging.

use: 
```c 
#define LOGNEST_DISABLE_TIMESTAMP
```

before defining the implementation.


- Fixed some UX around changing the file being logged to.

you can now do:

```c 
#define LOGNEST_FILE "path/to/log/filename.log"
```
before defining the implementation


## LogNest 2.0 

   - Improved compiler compatibility by removing some parts of the code that i didn't knew were GNU extensions.

 - Added new Macros for disabling a log level entirely

- you can now disable any log level with:

```c
#define LOGNEST_DISABLE_TRACE
#define LOGNEST_DISABLE_WARN
#define LOGNEST_DISABLE_ERROR
#define LOGNEST_DISABLE_DEBUG
``` 

That has to be defined before the implementation define, that is already before the #include

  -  Added a new macro that returns a c literal of the current LogNest version
